Sahutchai completed a DPhil (PhD) degree from the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford. 
His thesis explored the capacities of Euglena metabolic network using metabolic flux analysis techniques. 
He was working as a research fellow at University College London before moving back to Chiang Mai, Thailand, for his lectureship in Systems biology.
