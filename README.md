## **SAHUTCHAI INWONGWAN (GLA), DPhil**
### Scientist - Biologist - Biochemist
**Research Fellow, GEE, UCL, UK  
Lecturer, Dept BIOL, CMU, Thailand**

Sahutchai completed a DPhil (PhD) degree from the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford. 
His thesis explored the capacities of Euglena metabolic network using metabolic flux analysis techniques. 
He is now working as a research fellow at University College London. 
He investigates physiological effects of mito-nuclear incompatibilities in Drosophila.
