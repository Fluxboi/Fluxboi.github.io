Sahutchai completed a DPhil (PhD) degree from the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford. 
His thesis explored the capacities of Euglena metabolic network using metabolic flux analysis techniques. 
He was working as a research fellow at University College London before moving back to Chiang Mai, Thailand, for his lectureship in Systems biology.

His current research works include: 
- Metabolic modelling of Euglena for industrial applications
- Astrobiochemistry, modelling the optimal network for extraterrestrial conditions
- Investigating physiological effects of mito-nuclear incompatibilities in Drosophila 
- Metabolic analysis in cancer cells
- Bioinnovation for space
