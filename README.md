The **Systems Integration Laboratory (SI Lab)** at Chiang Mai University integrates experimental and computational approaches to uncover how living systems function, adapt, and can be engineered for impact.  

Our vision is to **connect biology across scales** — from genes and metabolites to organisms and ecosystems — through **systems biology, bioenergetics, and metabolic modelling**. We bridge **fundamental research** with **applied innovation**, addressing challenges in **health, sustainable resources, and astrobiology**.  

The lab’s projects span multiple frontiers of biology:  
- **Mitochondria and chloroplast coordination in *Euglena gracilis*** to depict the bioenergetic synergy and metabolic adaptation  
- **Metabolic modelling of *Euglena gracilis*** for carbon capture, bioactive compounds, and industrial biofactory applications  
- **PM2.5–cancer cell interactions**, using multi-omics to understand oxidative stress, metabolic rewiring, and therapy resistance  
- **Fermentation science**, developing new processes and microbial strategies for high-value fermented beverages  
- **Astrobiology and astrobioinnovation**, modelling life’s resilience under extraterrestrial and space-analog conditions  
- **Honeybee microbiome and symbiosis**, leveraging gut microbes for pollinator health and bioresource potential
