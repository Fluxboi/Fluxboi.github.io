# Opimising 'Life' via Learning about Metabolic Flux and Bioenergetic 
## SAHUTCHAI INWONGWAN (GLA), DPhil
### Scientist  

```
Sahutchai completed a DPhil (PhD) degree from the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford. His thesis explored the capacities of Euglena metabolic network using metabolic flux analysis techniques. Through years of numerous research programs, he has developed the substantial backgrounds in Molecular biology, Phycology, Microbiology, Biotechnology, Cell biology and Systems biology. He is now working as a research fellow at University College London, where he investigates physiological effects of mito-nuclear incompatibilities in Drosophila.
